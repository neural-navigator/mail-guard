## Introduction

The Email Processor and Spam Classifier is a cloud-based solution aimed at automating the process of email sorting and spam detection. It integrates with your email account to fetch emails, runs them through a text processing and analysis pipeline, and finally categorizes emails as spam or not. Additionally, the application offers a dashboard to provide useful analytics and insights into your email activities.

2. **Data Processor**: Processes the fetched emails and performs text analysis.
3. **Classifier**: Classifies the emails as spam or not.
4. **Dashboard**: Provides an interactive UI for users to view analytics and control settings.
